# Chai Culture - Coming Soon Landing Page

This is a premium, responsive "Coming Soon" landing page for a fictional Indian tea brand, **Chai Culture**. It was built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your computer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or download the source code.**

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd chai-culture-landing
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the local development server.

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the landing page by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5173` (the port may vary, check your terminal output).

## deployment

To create a production-ready build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates a `dist` folder in the project root, which contains the optimized and minified static files. You can deploy this `dist` folder to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
